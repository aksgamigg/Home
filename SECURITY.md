# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this is a personal portfolio and web project, only the latest deployment on the main branch is currently supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Main    | :white_check_mark: |
| Dev     | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I appreciate the effort of security researchers and fellow developers who take the time to report vulnerabilities. As a student developer, I value your input in helping keep this portfolio secure.

### How to Report
If you discover a security issue, please do **not** open a public issue on GitHub. Instead, report it responsibly:

1.  **Email:** Send details to `akshajgoel@bnpsramvihar.edu.in` or `akshajgoel7@gmail.com`
2.  **Subject:** Please use the subject line `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - aksweb.me`.
3.  **Description:** Include a proof of concept (PoC) or clear steps to reproduce the issue.

I will endeavor to acknowledge your report within 48 hours.

## Scope

### In Scope :dart:
*   The website hosted at `https://aksweb.me`
*   Client-side logic (JavaScript) vulnerabilities (e.g., DOM-based XSS in the Terminal or Modal components).
*   Improper access control on project assets.

### Out of Scope :no_entry_sign:
*   **DDoS / Spam:** Please do not run denial-of-service attacks or spam forms.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attacks targeting me personally (phishing).
*   **Third-Party Infrastructure:** Vulnerabilities related to GitHub Pages, Namecheap, or CDNs (please report those to the respective vendors).
*   **Scanner Output:** Automated scanner reports without a valid proof of concept.

## Bounties & Recognition

As I am a high school student, I **cannot offer monetary bug bounties** at this time. However, if you report a valid, non-trivial security vulnerability, I will heavily appreciate it and, with your permission, add your name/handle to a **Security Hall of Fame** in this document.

## Safe Harbor

I pledge not to pursue legal action against researchers who:
*   Conduct research without harming the site or its users.
*   Do not use the vulnerability to access non-public data.
*   Report the vulnerability to me directly and give me a reasonable time to fix it before making it public.
